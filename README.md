## 🚀 About

**P2PFlow** (Peer-to-Peer Synchronization CLI) is a lightweight, decentralized file synchronization tool designed specifically for development teams. Unlike traditional cloud-based sync solutions, P2PFlow enables **real-time collaboration** without relying on centralized servers, providing developers with:

- ⚡ **Instant synchronization** across team members on the same network
- 🔒 **Privacy-first architecture** with no data leaving your local network
- 🎯 **Zero configuration** - works out of the box with sensible defaults
- 🪶 **Minimal resource usage** - single lightweight binary
- 🌐 **Cross-platform support** - works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

### Key Differentiators

| Feature | P2PFlow | Traditional Cloud Sync | Git |
|---------|----------|------------------------|-----|
| Real-time sync | ✅ Sub-second | ⏱️ Minutes | ❌ Manual |
| No internet required | ✅ Local network | ❌ Required | ✅ Can work offline |
| Automatic conflict detection | ✅ Built-in | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ Manual resolution |
| Setup time | ⚡ < 2 minutes | ⏱️ 10+ minutes | ⏱️ 5+ minutes |
| Privacy | 🔒 Complete | ⚠️ Data on servers | 🔒 Self-hosted option |

## 💡 Why P2PFlow?

### The Problem

Modern development teams face several collaboration challenges:

- **Git overhead**: Constant commits, pulls, and pushes interrupt flow
- **Cloud sync lag**: Services like Dropbox/Google Drive have multi-second delays
- **Merge conflicts**: Disruptive and time-consuming to resolve
- **Privacy concerns**: Sensitive code passing through third-party servers
- **Network dependency**: Can't collaborate on local networks without internet

### The Solution

P2PFlow provides **real-time, peer-to-peer file synchronization** that:

1. **Eliminates sync friction** - Files update instantly across all team members
2. **Preserves privacy** - All data stays within your local network
3. **Handles conflicts gracefully** - Automatic detection with simple resolution
4. **Works everywhere** - Single binary, no dependencies, cross-platform
5. **Integrates seamlessly** - Works alongside Git, doesn't replace it

### Perfect For

- 🏢 **Co-located teams** working in the same office
- 👥 **Pair programming** sessions requiring instant file sharing
- 🎓 **Educational environments** where students collaborate on projects
- 🏠 **Home lab setups** with multiple development machines
- 🚀 **Rapid prototyping** sessions where speed matters
